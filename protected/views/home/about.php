				<h3>When do I need to see a doctor for my back pain and neck pain?</h3>

				<p>You should see your doctor if the back pain does not show any sign of improvement within a month or you feel unwell. Your doctor will ask detailed questions, do physical examination and order some radiological investigations to determine what could be the cause of the problem. Generally the cause is not serious. The doctor may give you medicine to control the pain. It is not advisible to take pain killer for a long term because of its side effects. Less than 5% of back pain and neck pain are caused by something more serious such as tumor, infection, fracture and nerve compression. These conditionsoften require early treatment. </p>

				<h3>When do you need to have physiotherapy treatment?</h3>

				<p>Most of back pain and neck pain can be treated with physiotherapy. The doctors will decide if physiotherapy treatment is suitable for you. The aims of the physiotherapy treatment are to first control the pain to an acceptable level and then to strengthen the back and neck muscles. Strong muscles stabilize the spine to further reduce the pain from instability and to reduce the rate of ageing in the spine. </p>

				<h3>What to expect after physiotherapy treatment?</h3>

				<p>On the first physiotherapy visit, the physiotherapist will advise you on how many times and how often you need to have the physiotherapy treatment. Usually the pain improves significantly within a few weeks. If there is evidence of ageing in the spine, the pain may not go away completely. The pain may come back on and off. You may require more frequent treatment to control the pain. </p>

				<h3>What other treatments can I have for my back and neck pain?</h3>

				<p>Other treatments like yoga, pillate and massage may help to control the pain. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging and swimming help to strengthen the back and neck muscles. We do not encourage our patients to have chiropractic treatment. It is generally not harmful. However, there are differences in the philosophy on the causes and the management of spine problems.  </p>
